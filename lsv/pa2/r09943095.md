# PA2 Report 

## Algorithm (baseline approach)

```
foreach PO of original circuit begin
    extract a single output cone circuit
    if PO is complemented, complement the output of cone circuit

    convert the cone to a AIG network
    derive a CNF F from the AIG network

    duplicate CNF F and reanme variables to represent F'
    create a new sat solver and add CNF F and F' to sat solver 

    foreach PI of cone circuit begin
        adds clauses to assert the equivalence between two variables controlled by an enabling variable alpha.

        create a mapping table, map the name of PI to the id of PI
    end

    foreach PI of original circuit begin
        if PI is a spported CI of cone circuit begin
            solve sat with assumption to check positive unateness
            flip the cofactor assumption
            solve sat with assumption to check negative unateness
        end

        add the results id to vectors
    end

    print the results
end
```

## Data Structure
- Abc_Ntk_t*
- Abc_Obj_t*
- Aig_Man_t*
- Aig_Obj_t*
- Cnf_Dat_t*
- sat_solver*
- vector< int >
- unordered_map< string, int >

## APIs
- Abc_NtkCreateCone()
- Abc_NtkToDar()
- Aig_ManFlipFirstPo()
- Cnf_Derive()
- Cnf_DataDup()
- Cnf_DataLift()
- sat_solver_new)()

- Cnf_DataFree()

- Abc_NtkDC2()

## Optimization over the baseline approach
- Reduced the # of PI of cone circuit
  - Unsupported CI is unnecessary
- Change the order of assumption
  - I notice that different orders may have an impact on runtime for some cases
- Convert to fraig and optimize combinational AIG 
  - Use `Abc_NtkDarFraig` and `Abc_NtkDC2`

## Discussion

1. Can your implementation solve the remaining 7 test cases (possibly with a longer time limit)?

    No, just solve two extra test cases in 20 hours.

    Limit: 20H
    |Cases     | Runtime(s) |
    |----------|:----------:|
    |voter     |     X      |
    |div       |     X      |
    |hyp       |     X      |
    |log2      | 10626.39   |
    |multiplier|     X      |
    |sqrt      |     X      |
    |square    |   624.92   |

2. How does your implementation compared to the BDD-based command `print_unate` in ABC?

    - BDD-based method use an algorithm that is conceptually similar to the algorithm for two-variable symmetry computation 

    - Our implementation is a SAT-based method which use sat solver to prove the satisfiability

3. What are the differences between random control and arithmetic circuits? Which category is more challenging?

    - The arithmetic circuits usually have a higher level when using AIG to represent. It may produce too many variables when we derive CNF from AIG. So, I think arithmetic circuits are more challenging base on our implementation.
